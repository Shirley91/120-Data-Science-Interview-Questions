#### 3. How would you explain an A/B test to an engineer with no statistics background? A linear regression?
  - A/B testing, or more broadly, multivariate testing, is the testing of different elements of a user's experience to determine which variation helps the business achieve its goal more effectively (i.e. increasing conversions, etc..)  This can be copy on a web site, button colors, different user interfaces, different email subject lines, calls to action, offers, etc. 
  - We have a response variable and a set of related variables that can aid in predicting the response. And the response and the predictors are linearly related. For example, the relationship between height and weight of people, tall person would have a heavier weight than short people.
  
#### 4. How would you explain a confidence interval to an engineer with no statistics background? What does 95% confidence mean?
  - Confidence intervals give a range of values which will contain the population value of a parameter a certain % of the time. An x% confidence interval is like an oracle or weather forecaster that is right x% of the time. However, for any particualr sample, you don't know if it contains the mean or not, but you trust that it does becasue it is right X% of the time (with X being reasonably hight, like the canonical 95%), just like if a weather foreacaster predicts rain, and they have a track record of being right 95% of the time, then you'd be well served to take an umbrella.

#### 5. How would you explain to a group of senior executives why data is important?
  - Data can help companies understand their customers. Many companies have data on their customers; however this data is organized within different departments and databases. It is important for companies to organize this data into one accessible data warehouse so that companies can acquire a complete view of their customer. 
  - When a company can see a "360 degree view" of their customers then key questions such as "What do my customers look like?", What products have they purchased?", and "What will keep them loyal?" can be answered.  Additionally, companies with a clear, comprehensive customer view can pinpoint revenue opportunities. These companies can align the right offers to the right consumers, drive up-sell and cross-sell opportunities, increase customer retention and loyalty, maximize customer value, etc.

#### 10. How would you convince a government agency to release their data in a publicly accessible API?

#### 11. I’m a local business owner operating a small restaurant. Convince me to switch my advertising budget from print to internet.
  - With the Internet, you automatically have access to more customers. Instead of finding a small ad buried in a newspaper with declining revenues, people can find you through a variety of services that promote local businesses (Yodle) and restaurants (Yelp). You can use FaceBook to advertise your business and spread your reputation through word-of-mouth.
